# Weird Philosophy

## Structured Programming

We're trying to organise code - the paradigm itself doesn't 
really model the real world, but we can do that with our 
code if we want to.

## Object Oriented Programming

This paradigm models the real world as objects that know 
things and do things. In the world, the interactions of 
these objects causes them to change their state, create 
other objects, destroy other objects and so on. An object 
oriented program generally solves problems using these same
mechanisms. This is intuitive because it is similar to our
mental model of the world.

## Functional Programming

But is the world really about objects and things? Alan Watts 
says *"the universe doesn't come __thinged__"*, rather - we
thing the universe. Objects only really exist in our mental
model and not only is that not an accurate representation of
the world, it is not always the best way to model it. 
Functional programming models the real world as a process -
a continuous stream of changes and transformations. We try
to avoid state changes and mutable data.
